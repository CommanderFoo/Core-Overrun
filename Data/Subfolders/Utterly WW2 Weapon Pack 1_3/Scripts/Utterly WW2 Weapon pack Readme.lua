:: Usage
1) If using one of the Core Advanced Weapons templates then drag the chosen weapon template from:
   Core Content > Game Components > Weapons > Advanced 
   into your games hierachy.  
2) Expand the above template to locate the Geo folder. Delete everything inside this folder (But not the folder itself). 
   Deinstance template when prompted
3) Drag the Utterly WW2 weapon template onto the Geo folder. 
4) Adjust and customise weapon to suit. 

Note: if the weapon does not look correct within the players hands then you may need to adjust the postion. 
Copy the correct hand positon guide into your weapon template and move the weapon model group until happy with the postioning. 
The weapon hand guides are found  in Core Content > Art Objects > Utility
    knife = Weapon Guide 1hand_melee
    pistol/revolver = Weapon Guide 1hand_pistol
    rifle/smg/lmg = Weapon Guide 2hand_rifle
For some 2 handed weapons it is not possible to get a perfect fit due to the weapons shape. The 2 rifles are in this category,
as the rifles do not have the pistol type grip that the hand guide expects.  Hopefully additional hand guides will be released in 
the future.
